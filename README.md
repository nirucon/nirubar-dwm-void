# nirubar-dwm-void

**nirubar-dwm** is a customizable status bar script for Void Linux and [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/), a lightweight window manager. This script provides a clean and informative status bar by displaying various system metrics and tools, tailored to enhance your workflow.

## Features

### Audio Volume

- **Function**: Displays the current audio volume level and mute status.
- **How It Works**: Uses `amixer` to get the volume level and mute status. Depending on the volume level, it shows different icons or text:
  - **Muted**: Shows a mute icon.
  - **Low Volume**: Displays a low volume icon with percentage.
  - **Medium/High Volume**: Shows a high volume icon with percentage.

### Brightness

- **Function**: Shows the current screen brightness level.
- **How It Works**: Uses `xbacklight` to retrieve and display the current brightness setting.

### Battery Status

- **Function**: Displays battery level and charging status if a laptop is detected.
- **How It Works**: Checks the presence of battery directories (`BAT0` and `BAT1`) in `/sys/class/power_supply/`. Uses these directories to read battery capacity and status, displaying relevant icons and information.

### CMUS

- **Function**: Displays information about the currently playing song in the CMUS music player.
- **How It Works**: Queries CMUS using `cmus-remote` to get details such as artist, title, position, and duration. Displays the playback status and optionally, shuffle status.

### Spotify

- **Function**: Shows information about the ongoing playback in Spotify or Spotifyd.
- **How It Works**: Checks if Spotify or Spotifyd is running. Uses `playerctl` to retrieve metadata about the currently playing track, including artist, title, position, and duration. Displays playback status and shuffle state.

### System Resources

- **Function**: Displays RAM and disk usage.
- **How It Works**: Uses `free` to get RAM usage and `df` to get disk usage information. Outputs usage stats with appropriate icons.

### Updates

- **Function**: Shows the number of available system and AUR updates.
- **How It Works**: Uses `checkupdates` to count the number of available system updates and `yay` to count AUR updates. Checks for updates at a regular interval (30 minutes) and caches the result to minimize update checks.

### Date and Time

- **Function**: Displays the current date and time.
- **How It Works**: Uses the `date` command to get and format the current date and time.
